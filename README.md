# Chancellor

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

### WARNING! THIS PROJECT HAS JUST STARTED DEVELOPMENT!

## About
Chancellor is a little side project I am working on where you get to run your own country! It's inspired (alot) by games like [WorldBox](https://www.superworldbox.com/), and [Minecraft](minecraft.net) (somehow).


## Tech Stuff
Made in LibGDX. 
That's it for now.

## Current progress
Just started. I have an asset and error-catching system, but that's it. Next up is Keybinds, and then rendering.

## Contributions.
I wont be taking contributions as I don't want to waste anybody's time. If this project ends up getting abandoned, I wouldn't want anybody else's work to go down the drain.
